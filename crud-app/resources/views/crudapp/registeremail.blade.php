        <h2>Thanks For Create Account With Us</h2>

        <p>Welcome To Our Website {{ $data["name"] }} </p>

        <p>Thanks for joining us. This is the quintessential Thank you email. Whatever you do, make sure you set this one up before any other type.<br>
        When someone registers for your product/service, they engage with your business.<br>
        This is why you should be there on Day 1 to thank them for signing up or joining you.<br>
        Use this email as an opportunity to say something that does not require further action from them.
        <br>
        At the beginning of the joint journey with your customers, make sure that you thank them for being there. So, this first email also works as a welcome email"."</p>";</p><br>
